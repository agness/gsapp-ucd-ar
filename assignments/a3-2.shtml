                    <h2>Back to the field</h2>
                    <p>Remember that testing many can produce better insights than testing one. So, bring your three prototypes to at least four representative users out in the field. Think of this as <b>needfinding with props</b>. Ask your studio staff if you need help gaining access to users.</p>

                    <p>Set the stage — the user's problem or goal — and remind the user that you are trying to test the prototypes, not the users. Take notes as they use each of your prototypes. When they are done, talk with them more holistically about the three prototypes. Find out what resonated with each prototype relative to the others, and what missed the mark. Usability isn't your focus right now: your primary goal is to gain insight into the broader design space and your general design ideas. Are they hitting on real needs? Are they helpful but incremental?</p>

                    <p>Write up a summary of your findings. First, describe your method and who you tested with. Second, tell us what you saw. Third, tell us your interpretation and reflections. What did the feedback imply about your original design questions that led to the prototypes? What changes will it prompt? Focus on concept, not usability.</p>

                <div id="reflect" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Reflect and iterate</h2>
                    <p>Armed with your results from needfinding with prototypes, it's time to iterate.</p>

                    <p>First, reflect on the needs and How Might We questions you previously identified. Which ones do you no longer think are important or relevant? What are new ones you might not have see previously? Focusing, which one do you want to solve?</p>

                    <p>Second, reflect on your ideas. Flare again. Use your new experiences to brainstorm additional ideas around your revised How Might We questions. What new ideas come up? Which old ones should be amended? Can you revive or splice old ideas in interesting ways?</p>

                    <p>Use this insight to generate a new set of three ideas and a new set of three prototypes. These can be evolutions of your original ideas, or entirely new ideas, or a combination of both.</p>

                    <h3>On Canvas</h3>
                    <p>Pull everything together into your submission for A3-2 on Canvas. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A PDF with your user feedback from the needfinding with prototypes.</li>
                        <li>Three PDF or zip files, one for each revised prototype: the question each was trying to ask, and a description (including images) of each.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>In Studio</h3>
                    <p>Be prepared to present your user feedback and your final proposed design in five minutes in studio. Bring full-page color printouts of your user feedback (e.g., photos), and of your revised prototypes.</p>
