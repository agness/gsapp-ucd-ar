                        <p class="lead">CS 247 takes many of the concepts you learned in introductory design coursework and deepens them. You are no longer an amateur, so we won't be treating you like one. We look forward to seeing you exceed our high expectations.</p>

                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to critique as a component of how design is evaluated and improved.</p>

                    <!--
                    <p><b>Needfinding is "deep hanging out".</b> CS 147 focused on contextual inquiry-style user research. Needfinding is a much broader activity that involves more open-ended observation and interviewing. We'll begin getting comfortable with that here.</p>
                    -->

                    <!-- The first goal of P1 is to abandon a common error that new designers make: focusing on raw, surface-level description in needfinding. When students graduate from CS 147, typically their needfinding observations are still extremely surface-level (e.g., "It was loud, so we should find ways to make it quieter.") This time, the expectations are higher. We'll aim to turn those observations into focused needs.</p> -->

                    <!--<p><b>Design requires communication.</b> The better your communication cuts to the core of the idea, the more effective you are as a designer. It's your responsibility to ensure that others see the same thing in your ideas that you do. If they see something else, you need to accept a <i>mea culpa</i>: there's something you're not communicating clearly. Visual communication is a kind of interface design: if the recipient doesn't rapidly get it, then the interface (communication) needs to be tweaked.</p>-->

                    <h2>Equip yourself</h2>
                    <p>A good drawing pad or sketchbook is a critical part of the designer's toolkit. Make sure you've purchased a pad and pen and bring it to class on Friday. Act quickly, because we are not the only class on campus that's asking you to buy a sketchbook and they do sell out. Important features: <b>you must be able to easily tear out the pages</b> (so we can tape them on the walls), no lines, no flimsy pages, no tiny pages (we recommend at least 5"x8"), no thin-lined pens (go for something with a reasonably thick ink stream), and no pencils. The Stanford Bookstore sells drawing pads, as does <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+Art/@37.473066,-122.217582,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbb3a2902b9fb:0x40d44f8e06f1dc56">University Art</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Accent+Arts/@37.426745,-122.144873,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbae5939d8a8d:0x51810dd03fc0d3d1">Accent Arts</a>.

                    <h2>Interactive Explanations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Interactive Explanations are an emerging web trend to explain concepts using a combination of text and interactive visual elements to make the explanation more vivid and engaging for users. Here are two sites with professional examples:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul class="su-list">
                        <li><a href="http://distill.pub/" target="_">Distill</a> The mission of Distill is to recognizing outstanding work communicating and refining ideas in Machine Learning and adjacent topics. They are giving annual prizes of $10,000 for novel interactive explanations.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/" target="_">Explorable Explanations</a> A collection of interactive explanations on a variety of scientific concepts from many different authors.</li>
                    </ul>


                    The goal of an interactive explanation is to teach an idea primarily through the reader experiencing the concept, not through reading about it.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div id="prep" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Details</h2>
                    You will author <b>two critiques</b> for this assignment.
                    <ul class="su-list">
                    <li>
                    For the first critique, pick an interactive explanation from one of the two websites listed about. Write a critique that addresses the goal of "teaching through interaction." (Do not use the explanation discussed in class, "The Parable of the Polygons".)</li>

                    <li>For the second critique, pick an interface that you created, perhaps in CS 147. Tell us the high level goal of your application and write a critque based on that goal.</li>
</ul>
                    <p>Critique each interface. Each critique should be no more than 300 words. Feel free to use a combination of text and visuals. Remember that a critique is more than a usability inspection. Please begin each critique with a full page screengrab of the interface so that we can see it clearly.</p>

                    <p>Finally, write up one paragraph answering the following questions:
                        <ul class="su-list">
                            <li>Is your assessment subjective?</li>
                            <li>Do you think the subjectivity invalidates your assessment?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>Print out full-page versions of the interfaces or your annotated visual critique and bring it to class on Friday. We'll be looking at each others' work!</p>

                    <p>Please post any questions about this project or others to the class Piazza forum.</p>
