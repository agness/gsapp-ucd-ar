                    <h3>Iterate</h3>
                    <p>This is the iterative, deliberate practice part of the assignment. Based on the critiques from your studio staff and your peers, go back out into the field. Your studio instructor may have suggested a different place to go this time or different people to talk to. Gather more observations, interview more people, and gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of interest. Improve your interpretations and your How Might We? questions. The expectations are high now: blow us away!</p>

                <div id="poster" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h3>Presentation</h3>
                    <p>Create a four-minute presentation (e.g., Powerpoint, Keynote) communicating your final needfinding results: your most compelling observations, interpretations, and How Might We questions. Remember the principles of effective communitation: the presentation should not be a braindump, but instead an effective communicator of your main results.</p>

                    <h4>On Canvas</h4>
                    <p>Pull your final materials together into your A2 Part II submission folder. That means one PDF that includes revisions of all elements that were part of Part I, as well as a copy of your presentation slides.</p>

                    <h4>In Studio</h4>
                    <p>Your team will present your final results, using your slides, in studio.</p>
